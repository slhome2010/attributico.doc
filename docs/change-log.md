# What's New in This Version

This version includes several important changes.

- Support for version 2.3.x stores has been discontinued;
- Since OpenCart 3.0.x runs on PHP 7, only the folders and files of the corresponding versions are left in the download archive.
- To speed up the loading of trees, the *`Default Templates`* tab has been removed. **Default Templates** can be edited directly in the attribute tree;
- The `Clear Tree Cache` tool has been moved to the forefront as a button;
- [Events](/technical-specifications/events.md) have been added to reduce the impact of modifiers on the original OpenCart and to track data changes made outside the module;
- The database structure has been expanded to ensure compatibility with future advanced versions of the module.
